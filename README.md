This project focuses on the classification analysis of a dataset that contains extensive information on a variety of fruit-related characteristics. The main objective is to compare classification models: **decision tree and logistic regression** to identify and classify apples as good or poor quality fruit based on their unique characteristics, in order to ultimately perform classification on the new data. 

Steps to implement the core part of the project:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data preparation
- Splitting the dataset
- Learning the models
- Testing the models on the test set
- Optimization of models through selection of hyperparameters
- Comparing the performance of the algorithms and selecting the best model
- Using the optimized model to classify apples based on new data

This project focuses on using the most optimized model to effectively classify fruit, which will allow us to understand what characteristics are critical to identifying the different types of fruit in the dataset under study.
